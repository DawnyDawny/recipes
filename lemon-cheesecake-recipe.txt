Put the butter in a pan and melt it over a low temperature on the hob. Remove the pan from the heat. Add the biscuit crumbs to the melted butter 
and stir with a wooden spoon until completely mixed.
Tip the mixture into a 20cm springform cake tin. Use the bottom of a glass to flatten, and chill in the fridge for around 20 minutes.
Wash the lemon and grate the zest into a bowl. Cut the lemon in half and squeeze out the juice.
Place the cream cheese and sugar into a mixing bowl; beat until mixed together, and then whisk in the double cream. Pour in the lemon juice and zest, 
whisk until creamy.
Make sure the biscuit base is properly chilled then remove from the fridge. Pour the cream cheese mixture on top of the biscuit base, and spread it out evenly.
Put the cake in the fridge to chill for a couple of hours.
Unclip and remove cake tin and now it is ready to eat.
